# Ruby-Menu-Program
This is a simple menu program, all we need to do is create between 3 to 4 options for the user to choose from.
We are mainly using conditional statements for this project and other basic datatypes
We will discuss what we want the menu program to be about, such as a bank, movie, groceries, hospital programs or other things
The program should be made with a loop that lets the user choose different options under the same run, and have an option that terminates the loop such as "Exit"
